What does if __ name __ == Main do in Python?
Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs. if __name__ == “main”: is used to execute some code 
only if the file was run directly, and not imported.

json.load() takes a file object and returns the json object. A JSON object contains data in the form of key/value pair. The keys are 
strings and the values are the JSON types. Keys and values are separated by a colon. Each entry (key/value pair) is separated by a 
comma.

iterdir() method creates an iterator that lists the files randomly.

the .stem property excludes the suffix of the final component 'main.py' and provides only the name of the file 'main'.

The popen() function executes the command specified by the string command. It creates a pipe between the calling program and the 
executed command, and returns a pointer to a stream that can be used to either read from or write to the pipe.

.Pipe is a module in Python that easily connects the output from one method with the output from another method

. communicate() writes input (there is no input in this case so it just closes subprocess' stdin to indicate to the subprocess that 
there is no more input), reads all output, and waits for the subprocess to exit. feyh el timeout

The rstrip() method removes any trailing characters (characters at the end a string), space is the default trailing character to 
remove.

json objects are surrounded by curly braces { }. They are written in key and value pairs.

json.loads() takes in a string and returns a json object.

json.dumps() takes in a json object and returns a string.
converts the Python objects into appropriate json objects

.cpu() copies the tensor to the CPU, but if it is already on the CPU nothing changes. 
.numpy() creates a NumPy array from the tensor.

you can dynamically change the default rc (runtime configuration) settings in a python script or interactively from the python shell. 
All rc settings are stored in a dictionary-like variable called matplotlib.rcParams , which is global to the matplotlib package.
